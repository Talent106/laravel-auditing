# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome; to keep things organized, bug reports and pull requests should be done on the [GitHub main project](https://github.com/owen-it/laravel-auditing/issues).

All pull requests intended for the next release of Laravel Auditing should be done against the `master` branch.
